                <h3 id="CS">Young Computer Scientist/Software Developer</h2>
                <p>Computer Science has been my passion for past 3 years. My love began with programming a graphing calculator in High School - it didn't take long from making it display simple words to create mini-story telling games to have laugh with friends. Then, I moved onto Pascal to learn the basics of programming. From academic studies and personal projects, I have become proficient in <em>Java, C, and Python</em>, but also have experience in other languages such as <em>R, Matlab, Ruby, and so on</em>. </p>

                <p>Aside from academic works, I am trying to gain exposure to both mobile and web development by learning <em>Android Studio, and Ruby on Rails</em>. Lately, I also found strong interest in data science, and currently in the middle of study. It has been a wonderful journey thus far and I am still hungry to learn more.</p>

                <p>You can find what I have been working on by following <a class="link" href="./archives.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Working at a cafe for 5 years definitely was a great experience, and huge part of my life that shaped me into who I am today - sometimes, I miss working behind the espresso bar. Steaming milks carefully to get the perfect foam, trying out latte arts, experimenting with new flavours... What I miss the most is the quite atmoshphere of evening inside the cafe. I met many great people - both co-workers and customers. Only downside? Caffine addiction : )</p>

                <p>The ocean of bits and bytes is vast and wide - the board games are like remote, tropical islands where I can take a break from long day of surfing through codes. My 
                <a class="link" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/JinMos">collection</a> has not grown much, and I could not play as much as I used to have since I started my studies. However, I am still very much attached to them, and try to spare weekend to sit down, and enjoy a quite game. Rolling dices. Shuffling cards. Having a good time with friends. These are all the things that I enjoy aside from coding.</p>
